Firstly, I wrote a Python script using requests and BeautifulSoup to get news headlines from the BBC website.

I used soup.find_all("h2") to collect the headline tags from the HTML page.

After getting the text from tags, I saved the top 10 unique headlines into a file called headlines.txt.

I used conditions to check the response status and remove duplicates.

Finally, this project helped me understand how to scrape real-time data using simple Python code.
